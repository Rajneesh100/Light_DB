# Light_DB (DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS...)
This is a database which aims provide features of RDBMS such as acid properties and low read latency but will be able to handle the the heavy write lode like nosql
all the db operation will be done using api interface only just like cromadb
idea is combinaing some message queue for heavy load and a in memory storage for taking write load and fast read access... (this is so far what i'm asuming)
